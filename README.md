# Getting Started
To make changes to the Nuget code repository, you'll need to do a few things first.
1.  Make sure you have Git installed on your machine. 
    - Open command window.  Type:  `git --version`
    - If it is not installed, go here:  [Download Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
    - { *If you need help navigating through the setup wizard, talk to a Senior Developer.* }
2.  Once you have Git installed, create a folder on your local computer where the solution will live.  
    - *C:/Projects/Nuget*
3.  Open your favorite command window { *vim, bash, etc.* } and navigate to your solution path you created.
4.  Type:  `git clone https://UTSDevTeam@dev.azure.com/UTSDevTeam/UTSNuget/_git/UTSNuget` and press enter.
5.  It will ask you to authenticate using your UTS credentials.  
6.  Once authenticated, all the files will download and you'll be defaulted to the **Dev** branch.
7.  Open the solution in Visual Studio and make your updates.

# Accessing UTS Nuget Packages
If you compile the solution with the new WebAPI changes for the first time, chances are you will get a compilation error for UTS.Integration.  You'll need to configure Visual Studio to point to our UTS Nuget folder.  Follow the steps below.
1.  To configure this Nuget source, right click on the References folder for the project you need to add this to and click Manage Nuget Packagesâ€¦
2.  Click the gear next to the package source dropdown.
3.  Click the green plus sign in the upper right corner of the popup window.
4.  Two new sources will be added. Update the Name and Source for each source as follows:

    ### Production
    - Name: **UTSNuget** 
    - Source: **https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/UTSDevTeam/_packaging/UTSNuget/nuget/v3/index.json**

    ### Test
    - Name: **UTSNuget TEST** 
    - Source: **https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/UTSDevTeam/_packaging/UTSNuget.TEST/nuget/v3/index.json**
5.  Click Update button. Click OK.
    
    *Test should be used when you are testing new features that you don't want available for download by other developers (ie: in production).*

You can now rebuild your project, add nuget packages to your project and update versions.  

# Contributing
1.  Do **NOT** modify files while on any of the major 3 branches { **Dev, Test, master** }.
2.  Always check out a new branch before beginning work.  
3.  Follow our branching guildlines { *coming soon* }
4.  All work can be committed and pushed to your own remote feature branch.  All merges to Dev, Test and master **MUST** be initiated using a Pull Request.
    - Ask for assistance.
5.  Only **Dev** can be merged into **Test**.
    - Only to be done by an authorized user.
    - *Manager review may be necessary*.
6.  Only **Test** can be merged into **master**.
    - Only to be done by an authorized user.
    - *Manager review may be necessary*.
